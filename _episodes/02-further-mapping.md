We saw how to map data to a position in a scatterplot. But we are able to map 
the data to other elements of a plot, eg the color of the points.



~~~
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, colour = color)) +
  geom_point() 
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-chunk1-1.png" alt="plot of chunk chunk1" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The argument to which we are mapping the values in the column *color* is also called *colour*, making the code look a bit weird.

Are these colours suitable? Probably not. The authors of this coursematerial are not able to distinguish all of the colours. We will return to how to change colours in plots later in this course.

Not surprisingly, the "best" color, D have higher prices than the "worst"
color, "J".

A common mistake is to place the color argument a wrong place:

~~~
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price), colour = color) +
  geom_point()
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-chunk2-1.png" alt="plot of chunk chunk2" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
What happened to the colour? The colour argument is outside the aes() function.
That means that we are not mapping data to the colour!

What else can we map data to?


~~~
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, colour = color, size = table)) +
  geom_point()
~~~
{: .language-r}

Not at good plot... We need to think about the combination of stuff we want to
plot. Often two plots are better than trying to cram everything into a single plot.

What can be mapped to the plot depends on the geom we are using. 

Calling the help function, eg `?geom_point`, on a geom will provide insight on that
question. Doing it on the `geom_point()` function, reveals that x and y are mandatory
because they are in bold.

The list of stuff we can map data to in geom_point:

* **x**
* **y**
* alpha
* colour
* fill
* group
* shape
* size
* stroke

Different geom_ functions have different mandatory/required aesthetics.

## Not really mapping. Sorta.
Rather than mapping values from the data to an aesthetic, we can provide
values directly. One very useful aesthetic to play with, at least when
we have as many datapoints as we have here, is `alpha`:


~~~
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
`alpha` controls the transparency of the points plotted, and is a handy way of
handling overplotting, the phenomenon that multiple data points might be 
identical.

### What kind of shapes can we plot?

In principle any kind of shape. But without having to program them
ourself, these are available directly in ggplot. They are numbered, because it is easier to write "14" than "square box with upwardspointing triangle inside".


~~~
Scale for y is already present.
Adding another scale for y, which will replace the existing scale.
