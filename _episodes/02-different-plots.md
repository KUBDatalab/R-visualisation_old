Hvilke andre typer plots kan vi lave?

## Histogrammer

diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) +
  geom_histogram()
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

{: .output}

## SÃ¸jlediagrammer

## boxplots

## Violinplots

## og mange andre

ggplot2 is born with a multitude of different plots. And ggplot2 can be 
extended. 

A complete list of plots will be very long, and take up all the time for this
course.

Take a look at https://r-graph-gallery.com/

or at https://kubdatalab.github.io/R-graphs/ (NB a work in progress), where
we will collect weird and wonderful plots, when to use them, when not to 
use them. And how to make them.
