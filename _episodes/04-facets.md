### Small multiples

If we only make one plot we quickly runs into the problem of trying to plot 
too much information in the plot. Here we plot the price against carat,
color by the color of the diamonds. And represent their clarity by the
shape of the points:


~~~
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color, shape = clarity)) +
  geom_point()
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Warning: Using shapes for an ordinal variable is not advised
~~~
{: .warning}



~~~
Warning: The shape palette can deal with a maximum of 6 discrete values because more
than 6 becomes difficult to discriminate
ℹ you have requested 8 values. Consider specifying shapes manually if you need
  that many have them.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="../fig/rmd-04-unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" width="612" />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2</p>
</div>

This is probably not the best way to discover patterns in the data. It is 
actually so bad that ggplot warns us that we are using too many different shapes.

One way of handling that, is to plot "small multiples" of the data. 

Instead of plotting information on the clarity of the diamonds in one plot,
along with all the other information, we make one plot for each value of 
clarity. This is called facetting:


~~~
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~clarity)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="../fig/rmd-04-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" width="612" />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3</p>
</div>
Here we can see that the price rises more rapidly with size, for the better 
clarities, something that would have been impossible to see in the previous plot.

The fundamental idea behind faceting, is the concept "small multiples", popularised
by Edward Tufte. He describes it as (resembling) "the frames of a movie: a series 
of graphics, showing the same combination of variables, indexed by changes in 
another variable.” The method is also known as "trellis", "lattice", "grid" or
"panel" charts. They allows us to break down a very "busy" chart, containing too
much information, making it possible for the reader of the charts to walk
through them one category at a time, and make comparisons.

## More than one multiple

We can expand on the "small multiple" concept, by plotting the
facets in a grid, defined by two categorical values.

In this plot we plot price as a function of carate, and 
make individual plots for each combination of clarity and color:


~~~
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_grid(clarity ~ color)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="../fig/rmd-04-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" width="612" />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4</p>
</div>

Be careful using facets, especially *facet_grid* when you work
with small datasets. You might end up with too little data in 
each facet.
