### FACET_FUNCTION

There are more variables in this dataset. But it becomes increasingly difficult
to add information to a two dimensional plot. One way to overcome this might be to 
make more than one plot, based on values in the dataset.

This is called facetting:


~~~
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~clarity)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-04-unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

~~~
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(clarity ~ color)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-04-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
