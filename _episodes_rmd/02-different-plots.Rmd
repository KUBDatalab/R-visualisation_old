ggplot2 is born with a multitude of different plots. And ggplot2 can be 
extended. 

A complete list of plots will be very long, and take up all the time for this
course.

Take a look at https://r-graph-gallery.com/

or at https://kubdatalab.github.io/R-graphs/ (NB a work in progress), where
we will collect weird and wonderful plots, when to use them, when not to 
use them. And how to make them.
