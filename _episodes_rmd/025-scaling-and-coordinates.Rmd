The coordinate system can be changed. If we want to flip the coordinates, we
could interchange the x and y values in the mapping argument.
Or we could add a coordinate function that changes the coordinate system:

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_flip()
```
Other coord_ functions exists, the most commonly used are coord_flip and coord_polar:
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_polar()
```
That might not be that useful working with diamonds.
