## Changing scale and coordinates

ggplot choses a coordinate system for us. Like bins in 
histograms, that coordinate system might not be the right for
our data.

One of the more commonly cited "rules" for plots and graphs is
that the coordinate system should begin at zero. And ggplot
does not necessarily give us a coordinate system that begins at zero. So how do we force it to?

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(depth, table)) +
  geom_point()
```

We can control the axes precisely by adding xlim and/or ylim
to the plot. We need to provide these functions with a 
vector of length 2, indicating the minimum and maximum values
we want:

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(depth, table)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(c(0,80)) +
  ylim(c(0,100))

```

It is nice to be able to control the two axes seperately. 
Because the coordinate system should not always begin at zero.
Especially time-series, showing a development over time, 
should often *not* begin at zero. 

### Zooming

Let us zoom in on the plot above, and look at tables between
50 and 70, by adjusting the ylim:

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(depth, table)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylim(c(50,70))
```

That returns a warning! Some data is not within the limits we
placed on the y-axis. This might not be a problem. Or it might.

If we are doing more advanced stuff like scaling the axes (eg. logarithmically), cutting of data might be a bad idea.

Zooming in on particular areas of the plot is done better 
using the `coord_cartesian` function:

```{r cartesian-zoom}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(depth, table)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(50,70))
```

This will not cut out data from the plot, they are still there
for other geoms that might need them, they are simply not
plotted.

### Why would that be a problem?

That would be a problem, because the `ylim` approach removes data before the 
plot is actually made. Functions that would use these removed data will no
longer have access to them. Let us show - without going deep into what is 
actually happening, the difference.

We can add a smoothing function to a plot, that adds a trendline to the data.
This smoother is based on all the data available to it. Let us make two plots,
one where we zoom using `ylim`, and one where we zoom using `coord_cartesian`:

```{r zoom_comparison}
library(patchwork)
p1 <- diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(depth, table)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylim(c(50,70)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle("Zoom by ylim", subtitle = "Smooth only uses a subset of data")

p2 <- diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(depth, table)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(50,70)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle("Zoom by coord_cartesian", subtitle = "Smooth uses all data") 


print(p1 + p2)

```
The trendlines are very different, because the data they are based on is
different.

## Changing the coordinate system

We saw above that we could adjust the coordinate system in order
to zoom in on specific parts of the plot. We can do other things
with the coordinate system!

Should we want to flip the coordinates, we
could interchange the x and y values in the mapping argument.
Or we could add a coordinate function that changes the coordinate system:

```{r flipped-coords}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_flip()
```



Other coord_ functions exists.

### Log-scale

With data that span several orders of magnitude, it is often useful to plot it in a
logarithmic or double-logarithmic coordinate system. That might reveal structure
in the data that is otherwise invisible.

And sometimes, eg in chemistry studying reaction kinetics, we use 
logarithmic scales to address logarithms in the model we have for our data.

By default ggplot comes with the function `scale_y_log10` that will transform
the y-axis to a logarithmic scale using base 10 for the logarithm. The equivalent
function `scale_x_log10` does the same for the x-axis. If you need the natural
logarithm, you will need to look into the package `scales`:


```{r log-transform-y}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10()
```
This plot reveals a gap in the prices. There are no diamonds in this dataset
with a price between 1454 USD and 1546 USD. The educated guess is an error in 
the original dataset.

### Pie charts - the forbidden charts

A very popular plot type is pie charts. Pie charts in ggplot
can be defined by making a stacked bar-chart, and changing the
coordinate system to polar.

We begin by filtering the data set to only include diamonds
with the color "G", and then make a barchart. We add the 
argument `position = "stack"` to `geom_bar` to stack the bars
rather than having them side by side. And then we adjust
the coordinate system to be polar (the y-axis specifically), 
beginning at 0:

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  mutate(color = as.character(color)) %>% 
  filter(color == "G") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= color, fill = cut)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) 
```

> Each point in the system are defined by two values, X and Y, representing 
> the distance from the origin or reference point of the coordinate system.

> In a polar coordinate system, each point in the plane is defined by two values:

## Coloring the scale

Looking at the plot below, the authors of this course get pretty frustrated.


```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) +
  geom_point() 
```

We are not really able to distinquish the color for "D" and "E". Or for "G" and
"H". Controlling the colors is important not only for aesthetic reasons, but
also for actually illustrating what the plot is showing.

Here, the color is introduced by mapping the color of the diamonds to the 
coloring of the points. This actually is mapping a value to a scale, no different
from the mapping of the price to the y-axis.

In the same way we can adjust the scale of the y-axis as shown above, we are
able to adjust the actual colors in the plot. 

The functions for this are (almost) all called `scale_` and then continues
with `color` if we are coloring points, `fill` if we want to control the 
fill-color of a solid object in the plot, and finally something that specifies
either the type of data we are plotting, or specific functionality to control 
the color. 

Below we adjust the color using the special family of functions `brewer`:
`scale_color_brewer`. Nice colors, but even worse:

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"))
```
What we did to change the background will be covered in the next episode.

Finding the optimal colors usually requires a lot of fiddling around. Rather
than using functions to choose the colors, we can chose the manually, 
like this:

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values=c('#7fc97f','#beaed4','#fdc086','#ffff99','#386cb0','#f0027f','#bf5b17'))
```

The codes #7fc97f are "hex-codes", specifying the colors. You can find websites
allowing you to chose a color, and get the code. A good place to get suggestions
for color-pallettes is [Colorbrewer2](https://colorbrewer2.org/).
