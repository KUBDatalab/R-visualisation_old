## Why even visualise data?

Data can be complex. Data can be confusing. And a good visualisation of data
can reduce some of that complexity and confusion.

A good visualisation can reveal patterns in our data.

A really good visualisation can even provide insight that is difficult, or
impossible to find without.

A good example is this map, where the English physician John Snow plotted the 
deaths from Cholera in Soho, London from 19th august to 30th September 1854. 



![John Snow cholera map - Wellcome Trust, (CC BY 4.0) ](../fig/snow_cholera_map.jpg)

The concentration of deaths indicated that the source of the disease was a 
common water pump. Removing the handle from the pump brought an end to the 
outbreak.

We are probably not going to discover patterns of equal importance in this course.



## The dataset we are working with

We are going to study a dataset containing information on prices and other attributes
of 53940 diamonds. The dataset is included in the `ggplot2` package, that we
installed as part of `tidyverse`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
head(diamonds)

```

There are 10 variables in the dataset:

| Variable | What is it? |
|----------|-------------|
| carat    | Weight of the diamond in carat (0.200 gram) |
| cut      | Quality of the cut of the diamond (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal) | 
| color    | Color of the diamond from D (best), to J (worst) |
| clarity  | How clear is the diamond. I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best) |
| depth    | Total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) |
| table    | Width of the top of the diamond relative to its widest point |
| price    | Price in US dollars |
| x        | Length in mm | 
| y        | Width in mm |
| z        | depth in mm |

Slightly more detailed information can be found in the help for the dataset:
```{r eval =F}
?diamonds
