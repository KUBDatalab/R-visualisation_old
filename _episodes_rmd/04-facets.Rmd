### FACET_FUNCTION

There are more variables in this dataset. But it becomes increasingly difficult
to add information to a two dimensional plot. One way to overcome this might be to 
make more than one plot, based on values in the dataset.

This is called facetting:

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~clarity)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(clarity ~ color)
```
